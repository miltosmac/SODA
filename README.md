### Introduction 

This architecture is based on the work done in [[1]](#1) which in turn is an expansion on [[2]](#2). The challenge
that this design addresses is the optimality of the design when more than one Computation Kernels (CKs)
are used in a single stage, where a CK is a compute module that implements the kernel function. That
means that more than one inputs are processed at each clock and more than one outputs are produced
by the design. Essentially, [[1]](#1) introduces an optimal design that exploits spatial parallelism, i.e., the
concurrent calculation of results within the same clock cycle.

This architecture proposed in [[1]](#1) retains the properties that the architecture in [[2]](#2) achieves and
extends them to a design with multiple CKs. Firstly, the design is fully pipelined, meaning that the CKs are
able to consume one new input every clock. Additionally, it fully reuses the input data so that they only
need to be fetched once from external memory, as well as creating a memory system with the minimum
reuse buffer size. It is important to note that the input elements are lexicographically ordered and
streamed into the design. The architecture developed computes a 9-Point Jacobi kernel, therefore the
structure presented below is dedicated to the stencil pattern of a 9-Point stencil (square).

### Detailed Explanation

#### Single Time-Step

The figure above provides an overview of the accelerator. Given that 𝑛 is the arbitrary number of CKs, the
design inputs 𝑛 new data from external memory, these inputs are concurrent, i.e., they happen
simultaneously through 𝑛 different input ports at the same clock cycle. At the next cycle 𝑛 new inputs are
introduced and so forth, ensuring the streaming of data in every port. These data are introduced to the
memory system that feeds the CKs with the appropriate data. Then 𝑛 results are calculated in the
respective kernels and are forwarded to the Output Handler. In turn, the Output Handler, determines
whether data should be outputted, if that is the case, it decides to output either from the CKs, or directly
from the memory system, in case of halo data. The operation of the Output Handler ensures streaming
output of data, in lexicographic order.

An example of 𝛫 = 4 CKs available, hence 4 concurrent computations, will be considered. The figure
presents a 2-dimensional grid 𝐴, of dimension size 𝐻𝐸𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑇 and 𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻 with their corresponding iteration
variables being 𝑖 and 𝑗. Note that the iteration starts at " − 1" for both dimensions, this is a design choice
that has to do with the layout of the created memory system. Moreover, the iteration step is equal to 𝑛,
so as to have 𝑛 elements processed in each clock cycle. The width of the array is denoted as 𝑊 and the
numbering written on the cubes marks iteration distances among them using as starting point the element
in [0,0]. To ensure the correct operation of the design, it is essential that 𝑛 should perfectly divide the
total width of the innermost loop of the stencil kernel, i.e., 𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻.

The elements required for the computation of 𝑛 results are represented as the cubes highlighted in
red. The ones that are stored on-chip without contributing to the calculation of the current clock cycle are
highlighted in green. The sum of the highlighted cubes represents all the elements that need to be stored
in internal memory. The opportunity to reuse these data manifest itself as most of them take part in more
than one computation. The memory system carries out this task. Elements are divided into 𝑛 sets,
according to their iterator’s remainder modulo 𝑛, as described in the following equation.

𝑗 % 𝑛 = 𝑥

In the example of _n=4_ where the data needed for calculation are named and highlighted in red,
the resulting data sets of Equation the equation above are presented below.
 
𝑗 % 4 = 3 ⟶ {−𝑊 − 1, −𝑊 + 3, −1, 3, 𝑊 − 1, 𝑊 + 3} 

𝑗 % 4 = 2 ⟶ {−𝑊 + 2, 2, 𝑊 + 2}

𝑗 % 4 = 1 ⟶ {−𝑊 + 1, 1, 𝑊 + 1}

𝑗 % 4 = 0 ⟶ {−𝑊, −𝑊 + 4, 0, 4, 𝑊, 𝑊 + 4}

These 𝑛 sets are called Reuse Chains and considering that for each clock cycle the design inputs 𝑛
elements and generates 𝑛 consecutive output elements, it becomes apparent that each new element is
introduced to a corresponding chain. The Figure above accurately maps the how the data elements of the example
in the previous Figure are fed in $𝑛 = 4$ Reuse Chains. The elements in every chain are characterized by a specific
color (red, green, blue, and yellow).

![alt text](https://github.com/miltosmac/SODA/blob/main/SODA_Illustrations/SPTA_Memory_System.jpg?raw=true)

The collection of these Reuse Chains makes up the memory system. The memory system is referred
to as the Reuse Buffer and, for an arbitrary number 𝑛 of CKs available, is presented in the above Figure. The Reuse
Chains are further fragmented into memory elements, either registers or FIFOs. The data elements in the
Reuse Chains that need to be available for computational purposes in an arbitrary clock cycle, are stored
in registers, that are denoted as 𝑅_0, 𝑅_1, etc. The need for parallel access to these elements in order to
propagate their values to the CKs, justifies the use of independent memory units. The rest of the data are
destined for computations in following clock cycles, and thus are stored in FIFOs. With every clock cycle
the data are shifted through each reuse chain. One new input is introduced, each memory unit feeds the
following and receives new input from the previous one, therefore the values inside the FIFOs are shifted
and new elements that are ready to be forwarded to the CKs, are available in the registers.

Since the numbered elements in each set have the same remainder modulo 𝑛, the minimum iteration
distance between them will be 𝑛. If the interval length equals to 𝑛, then the elements are stored in
consecutive registers (e.g., elements −𝑊 − 1 and −𝑊 + 3 are separated by distance 𝑛 = 4, thus are
stored in consecutive registers in the red reuse chain, as shown in the previous Figure). If the interval length exceeds
𝑛 then the intermediate elements are stored in the FIFOs.

An important distinction among the Reuse Chains is present in the architecture and depicted in the Reuse Buffer figure
and classifies them in two categories. The first $(𝑗 % 𝑛 = 𝑛 − 1)$ and last $(𝑗 % 𝑛 = 0)$ chains have a
different layout compared to the other ones. These two chains will be mentioned as edge chains to
differentiate them from the intermediate ones. This difference in structure, is a direct result to the fact
that our design implements a square stencil pattern, that is, a 9-Point stencil. On that account, the amount
of data forwarded to the CKs in edge chains, is more than the one in the rest of the chains. The data sets
calculated above as well as the color-coded mapping in the Grid Map Figure describe this effect explicitly. Six
elements needed to be used for every computation, are in each of the edge Reuse Chains, while only three
are needed from the rest.

A better understanding of the individual memory elements that each category utilizes is available on
the tables bellow. The first table provides an overview of data stored in the first Reuse Chain, when
considering the example of Figure 17 where 𝑛 = 4. The last Reuse Chain is structured in the same manner.
On FPGAs, large FIFO, whose capacity exceeds 1024 bits is implemented with BRAM and small FIFO is
implemented with SRL.

![alt text](https://github.com/miltosmac/SODA/blob/main/SODA_Illustrations/Edge_Chain_Size_Table.jpg?raw=true)

The size of the FIFOs can be derived as follows. Between element −𝑊 + 7, which will be the first
element stored in the FIFO_0, and −1, the iteration distance is $ −1 − (−𝑊 + 7) = 𝑊 − 8$  or $𝑊 − 2 ∗ 𝑛$,
where 𝑊 denotes the 𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻 and given than 𝑛 = 4. Howbeit, each chain stores every 𝑛^𝑡ℎ element.
Therefore, the number of elements stored in each FIFO of the first and last reuse chain, is:

$$ _FIFO_{edge_{size}}={WIDTH-2*n\over n } = {{WIDTH \over n} -2 } $$

This result is apparent in the Grid Map Figure where the FIFO stores every 𝑛^𝑡ℎ data element in the first row,
except from the first two. The total size of the Reuse Chain is the aggregate of the sizes of all the individual
memory elements in that buffer. In the case of the first and last chain, that is:

$$ _Chain_{edge_{size}}={{2*WIDTH\over n} -4 +6}={{2*WIDTH\over n} +2} $$

Which in turn is also evident in the Grid Map Figure, as the edge Reuse Chains store every 𝑛^𝑡ℎ data of the first
and second rows, as well as 2 elements from the third.
The second table presents the synopsis of the first intermediate buffer and the individual memory
elements in which it is broken down. The table examines the Reuse Chain highlighted in color blue, in the
Grid Map Figure, although all intermediate chains follow the same layout.

![alt text](https://github.com/miltosmac/SODA/blob/main/SODA_Illustrations/Inter_Chain_Size_Table.jpg?raw=true)

The FIFOs of these Reuse Chains store every n^th data element of a row except from one element. The first element in the first FIFO,
as presented in the Grid Map Figure, will be the one named $-W+5$, hence 

$$ _FIFO_{intermediate_{size}}={1-(-W+5)\over n}={(W-4)\over n}={(W-n)\over n}={{WIDTH\over n}-1} $$

Where W denotes the WIDTH of each row. As follows, the sum of individual memory element sizes makes up the total size of the intermediate Reuse Chain.

$$ _Chain_{intermediate_{size}}={{2*WIDTH\over n}-2+3}={{2*WIDTH\over n}+1} $$

Where the assumption that n>1 has been made, ergo, there are 2 edge Reuse Chains and n-2 intermediate ones. 
Considering the example of the Grid Map Figure where n=4 and utilizing the equation above we conclude that the whole buffer has a total size of $2*WIDTH+6$. 
This result is apparent in the aforementioned Figures where the two first rows and six more elements of the third are buffered on-chip. 
An important observation ensues if n=1, that is, when only one CK is available, 
therefore one element is received as input and one element is calculated and outputted. 
The design does not implement parallelism and is diminished to the TCAD design, described in [[2]](#2).

The Output Handler of the design mimics the function of the one of STSA. 
It receives data from the Computation Kernel and utilizes control logic to decide whether to forward data to the output ports, 
as well as deciding the nature of these data, that is, halo or computed data. It should be emphasized that a delay is introduced in the output of the calculated data.
Given the fact that n results should be outputted simultaneously, 
along with the need to input the element at the position [i+1,j+1] in order to calculate the result at position [i,j], creates a subsequent delay of (WIDTH+1)/n. 
The divisor n is a result of the iteration step that has the same size. 
In the example presented in Figure 16, the first n=4 outputs of the CKs are available once the element named W+4 is read. 
Subsequently, elements named 1 through 4 are outputted. 
The control logic of the Output Handler ensures the continuous flow of data in the output ports by introducing the same delay, 
of WIDTH+1 clock cycles, to the output of halo data. 
The aforementioned data are already situated inside the reuse chains in registers R_1 and R_2 for intermediate and edge chains respectively. 
In order to better understand the output delay.

It should be noted, that alike the TCAD architecture, the SODA has an intrinsic latency. 
This is the time measured in clock cycles, necessary to forward data to the CK’s from the Reuse Buffer, compute the results and output the calculated data. 
This intrinsic latency is measured from the cycle that the data required for a computation is read, 
until the computed value is outputted, and will be denoted as SPTA_Latency. 
Therefore, for the total latency of the design, all the grid elements should be traversed, ergo $WIDTH*HEIGHT$ iterations, nonetheless, we now utilize a step of n.

$$ Latency={HEIGHT*{WIDTH\over n} + {WIDTH+1\over n} + SPTA_{Latency} } ⟹ Latency={(HEIGHT+1)*{WIDTH\over n}} +SPTA_{Latency}+1 $$

where the term $1\over n$ is quantized to one, given that clock cycle is a discrete quantitative variable. 
This results in “wasting” the final clock cycle, as is evident in the Figure below, only to output one last data element, instead of n. 
This is again a result of the 9-Point stencil pattern.

#### Multiple Time-Steps

![alt text](https://github.com/miltosmac/SODA/blob/main/SODA_Illustrations/Cascaded_SPTA.jpg?raw=true)

The architecture described up to now computes the Jacobi 9-Point stencil kernel for a single timestep.
To extend this work and implement iterations in the time domain, a simple approach would be to
replicate the hardware of the design, thus creating multiple stages, and cascading them together. The
outputs of the first stage will be the inputs of the second and so forth. The Figure above provides an overview of
a complete Cascaded SPTA architecture where two stages are cascaded. The overhead in hardware is the
individual channels that are created between the stages, depicted as blue boxes, in addition to the
replicated hardware of each stage. These channels are implemented as simple FIFOs and contain control
signals that inform the next stage about the availability of data, generated by the previous stage.
Therefore, the model is completely data driven.

![alt text](https://github.com/miltosmac/SODA/blob/main/SODA_Illustrations/Cascaded_SPTA_Latency.png?raw=true)

It ought to be noted that the succeeding stages do not wait for the completion of the previous ones
to initiate their operation. Contrary they start once their input data is available, ergo the stages work in a
parallel fashion. Figure 20 is an abstract representation of that type of parallelism, the first outputs of the
stage will be forwarded to the intermediate channels and then fed to the next stage. The streaming
property of a single stage, i.e., the ingrained ability to produce and consume 𝑛 data every consecutive
clock cycle, ensures that following stages can have new inputs available for every clock. Consequently, the
design of Cascaded SPTAs behaves in a streaming manner.

The total latency of a CSPTA design with 𝑘 stages cascaded, is the aggregate latency of the last design
along with the latency that the 𝑘 − 1 previous ones need to output the first set of data elements. The following equation
describes the total latency of one stage. The stencil kernel iterates over a 2-dimensional grid of size
$𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻 ∗ 𝐻𝐸𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑇$. Given that each stage provides the first outputs after
$ {𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻+1\over 𝑛} + 𝑆𝑃𝑇𝐴_𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 $, and the fact that the intermediate buffers add 1 clock cycle delay to the design, then the total latency of the
CSPTA architecture is:

$$𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = (𝐻𝐸𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑇 + 1) ∗ {𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻\over 𝑛} + 𝑆𝑃𝑇𝐴_{𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦} + 1 + (𝑘 − 1) ∗ ({{𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻 + 1}\over 𝑛}+ 1) + 𝑆𝑃𝑇𝐴_{𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦} ⟹$$

$$𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = (𝐻𝐸𝐼𝐺𝐻𝑇 + 𝑘) ∗ {𝑊𝐼𝐷𝑇𝐻\over 𝑛} + 2 ∗ 𝑆𝑃𝑇𝐴_{𝐿𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦} + 2 ∗ 𝑘 − 1 $$
